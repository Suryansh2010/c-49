<h2>Hello reader.</h2>
<p>My school is Repton School Dubai. I am a coder in WhiteHat Jr. and I am learning how to write in html. I like playing tennis and I love swimming. I have a baby sister and love playing with her. I also know how to play chess and I like a kind of sudoku called Kenken. My favourite pastime is reading and I always read for one hour before I sleep when I have school the next day.</p>
<p>This is a game I created myself called 'The Hummingbird Flight'. Click on the bird to access the game. In this game, you have to dogde the clouds by jumping. You need to press the space button to jump. If you touch the clouds the game will stop and you need to start again by pressing the restart button. You also can not let the bird fall.</p>
